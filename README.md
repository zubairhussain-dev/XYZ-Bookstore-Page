#  XYZ Bookstore Page

![Project Preview](preview.jpg)

This repository contains a simple bookstore webpage structure built using HTML5. This project focuses on organizing content using container elements, classes for reusable styling hooks, and IDs for unique elements.

##  Project Objective
To build a semantic HTML structure for a bookstore that displays product cards and navigation buttons.

## Key Concepts Practiced
* **HTML Boilerplate:** Setting up `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `html`, `head`, and `body`.
* **Containers (`div`):** Used to group related content, such as the `card-container`.
* **Classes:** Used `class="card"` and `class="btn"` to group elements that would share similar styles.
* **IDs:** Used unique identifiers like `id="sally-adventure-book"` to target specific books.
* **Interactive Elements:** Added buttons for "Buy Now", "View Cart", and "Checkout".
